#The code simulates the rock-paper-scissors code between two users
#The players determine the amount of matches they want to play
#A match can consist of several rounds
#In each match, players choose either rock, paper or scissor in the order player1_guess, player2_guess - (guess must be space separated and either P,R or S)
#An example of an input to a match of one round can be : PR   - (in this case, player1 plays Paper and player2 plays Rock)
#Another input to a match with 3 rounds can be: PR SS SR 
#The winner of the match is determined by the person with the most round wins.
#If both players play the same thing (PP, SS,RR), there is no winner for that round.
#For example, If player1 wins 2 rounds out of 3 rounds in a match, player1 wins the match.
#The overall winner of the game is determined by who won the most matches. 

#Code input workings and explanation
#The program prompts for both players names
#Enter Name1:
#Enter Name2: 
#input number of matches : 3
#match1 : PR SS  (it has 2 rounds)
#match2 : SS RS  (it has 2 rounds)
#match3 : PP  (it has 1 round)

#Player1 wins one round in match1, wins another round in match2, match3 ends in a draw
#The overall winner is Player1 with 2 points.
